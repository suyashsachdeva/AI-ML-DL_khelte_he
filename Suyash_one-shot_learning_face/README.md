# One-shot Learning for faces:

## Problem Statement
The problem statement for this project is to develop a one-shot learning model which would be able differentiate and remember 100 different faces.

## How does your work solve it
This work will solve this by making deeper and better CNN architecture instead of the previous shallow architecture with a maximum memory of 10 faces.
